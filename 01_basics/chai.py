# When we imported chai module from hello_chai file then we see a little changing in folders which is a new folder of name __pycache__
# And in answer the answer & print statements present in hello_chai are also executing while working in chai.py

#When we run our python code then our code first convert into byte code and then it is interpretated in PVM(Python virtual machine) and then it is converted into the machine code and they execute to hardware

# Script/Program --> Byte Code --> PVM --> Machine Code

#Byte Code is our program in the form of bytes and it is platform independent code and it only run into the PVM. We can run our python code anywhere if we have PVM. That's why python is so popular in cloud computing.
